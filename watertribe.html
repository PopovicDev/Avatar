However, this was not the case, and the barbarians were swiftly defeated by Tonraq's men, who managed to subdue the invasion force with the use of waterbending. The confrontation resulted in the flooding of the spirit forest, and several spirits attacked the Northern Water Tribe in retaliation at the destruction of their home. The angered spirits were pacified by Unalaq, however, who guided them back into the forest.

						A massive stretch of arctic tundra covers most of the North Pole. The inland tundra is mostly mountainous and inhabited by diverse fauna. The valleys of arctic mountain ranges also host small settlements, such as Yakone's village.
						<br><br>
						In contrast, the coastal arctic plains are highly treacherous. Only skilled arctic hunters travel on the open plains, but only stay for short periods of time. Heavy winter blizzards constantly pelt the tundra, and unstable ice sheets often give way under the slightest pressure. Even experienced waterbenders and warriors think twice before venturing into this environment.

					An ancient forest containing a portal to the Spirit World is located in the center of the North Pole, which can be opened during the solstices by the Avatar. Although the portal remained sealed until 171 AG, strong spiritual energy in the North still prompted spirits to dance in the skies, causing the celestial phenomenon known as the northern lights. The spirit forest also remained completely thawed until 151 AG, providing a sharp contrast to the surrounding tundras, which remain largely intolerable even to locals acclimated to polar conditions.

						A small expedition consisting of Avatar Korra, Chief Unalaq, Tonraq, Mako, Bolin, Desna, and Eska visited the South Pole in 171 AG following the spirit attack during the Glacier Spirits Festival in an attempt to calm the angry spirits rampaging throughout the tribe. Although the group was attacked several times by hostile dark spirits, Korra managed to reopen the Southern spirit portal through the use of the Avatar State, restoring spiritual balance in the South.

					On the eve of Harmonic Convergence, Team Avatar, along with <b><a href="characters/bumi.html">Bumi</a></b>, Kya, and Tenzin, attempted to enter the Spirit World via the portal.

Despite causing significant damage to the encampment, they were ultimately defeated and captured, save for Bumi. Using a mecha tank, the retired United Forces commander inadvertently destroyed the entire encampment, freeing the others in the process and allowing them to enter the portal prior to Harmonic Convergence.

					In an attempt to keep Unalaq from merging with Vaatu, Korra extradited the Water Tribe chief from the Spirit World through the portal and asked Mako and Bolin to keep him out. The brothers subsequently returned to the physical plane, where they defended the access to the portal. However, after a brief skirmish in the surrounding forest, Desna and Eska were able to overpower them and allow Unalaq to reenter the Spirit World through the portal. The bending brothers regained consciousness not long after and overpowered the twins, running into the Southern portal after Unalaq, with Desna and Eska following in their wake.

Mako and Bolin arrived shortly after to come to Korra's aid, but were quickly subdued by Unalaq. After defeating his opponents, Unalaq used his spiritual connection with Vaatu to grow to enormous proportions and touched the spirit lights to transport himself away from the South Pole.The three benders were later found by Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin, who carried them back to the Spirit World.

					The damage wrought on the Southern Water Tribe by the Hundred Year War upset the pole's spiritual balance and caused the spirits to conjure an enormous, constant tempest known as the Everstorm, which surrounded the pole. This, in turn, led to the forest becoming encased in ice. The forest eventually turned into a series of glacial caverns, penetrated by roots and inhabited by small, dragon-like spirits.

By the time of Unalaq's occupation, a large wall was constructed around the spirit forest, with watchtowers located at every junction. In addition, small tents were pitched directly outside the forest for use by the Northern troops.
