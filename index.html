<b><a href=#>Air Nomads</a></b> is the collective term for the monastic order of men and women who practice the discipline of airbending and the pacifistic ethics of their theocratic society. One of the four nations, the Air Nomads were wanderers by definition, but had four air temples, one located at each corner of the globe, found atop mountain ranges and under cliffs, in the northern Earth Kingdom and on three remote islands, all of which were hard for outsiders to reach. Unlike the other nations, those born to the Air Nomads were, without any seen exception, all benders due to the high level of spirituality of their people.

<p><b><a href=#>Aang (Zachary Tyler Eisen)</a></b> is the fun-loving, 112-year-old protagonist of the series, who is biologically twelve years old but was frozen in an iceberg for one hundred years. He is the current incarnation of the Avatar, the spirit of the world manifested into human form, whose duty is to maintain balance among the nations of the world. Aang is a reluctant hero, who would prefer adventure over his job as the Avatar and making friends over fighting the <b><a href=#>Fire Nation</a></b>.</p>

She becomes the first earthbender to learn to bend metal and is considered one of the most powerful earthbenders in the world.</p>

Unlike his companions, Sokka cannot bend an element, but the series, though it often makes him the victim of comedy at his expense, frequently grants him opportunities to use his ingenuity and weapons, including his trusty boomerang, a battle club, and a sword he forged from a meteorite.</p>

<img src=pictures/korra.webp alt=Korra width=270 height=300 loading=lazy>
<p class=paragraphs-font>
<span style=font-size:2rem><b>The Avatar</b></span> is an international arbiter whose duty is to maintain harmony among the four nations, and act as a mediator between humans and spirits. When the Avatar dies, their spirit is reincarnated in a new body, who will be born to parents in the next nation in a set order known as the Avatar cycle: <b>Fire, Air, Water and Earth</b>. By tradition, the new Avatar will travel the world to learn all four bending arts, after which they will begin in earnest their role as global peacekeeper. The Avatar can enter a condition known as the <b>"Avatar State"</b>, in which they temporarily gain the skills and knowledge of all their past incarnations. Although this is when they are at their most powerful, if the Avatar was ever killed while in the Avatar State, the reincarnation cycle would be broken and the Avatar would cease to exist.

A century ago, young <b><a href=#>Avatar Aang</a></b>, afraid of his new responsibilities, fled from his home and was forced into the ocean by a storm. He encased himself in suspended animation in an iceberg near the <b>South Pole</b>. Shortly afterward, <b><a href=#>Fire Lord Sozin</a></b>, the ruler of the <b><a href=#>Fire Nation</a></b>, launched a world war to expand his nation's empire. Knowing that the Avatar must be an <b>Air Nomad</b>, he carried out a genocide against the <b><a href=#>Air Nomads</a></b> with the help of a comet enhancing firebenders' power. A hundred years later, siblings <b><a href=#>Katara</a></b> and <b><a href=#>Sokka</a></b>, teenagers of the <b><a href=#>Southern Water Tribe</a></b>, accidentally discover Aang and revive him.

<b><a href=#>Aang</a></b> and <b><a href=#>Appa</a></b> are awoken a hundred years later by two siblings of <b><a href=#>Southern Water Tribe</a></b> origin, <b><a href=#>Katara</a></b> and <b><a href=#>Sokka</a></b>. Aang learns that the <b><a href=#>Fire Nation</a></b> started a war a hundred years earlier, just after his disappearance. The Fire Nation's opening move in its campaign for global conquest was to launch a genocidal attack on the <b><a href=#>Air Nomads</a></b> which drove Aang's entire race to extinction, thus making him "the last airbender" left alive. He realizes that he must fulfill his destiny of becoming a fully realized Avatar and return balance to the world by defeating the Fire Nation. Aang sets out to master the three unlearned elements: <b>water, earth, and fire</b>. With Katara and Sokka, Aang decides to head first to the <b>North Pole</b> to find a waterbending master.
</p><br>
<p class=paragraphs-font>
Aang soon discovers that Sozin's Comet, which <b><a href=#>Fire Lord Sozin</a></b> used as a power supply to start the Hundred Year War, will return in the coming summer, giving the Fire Nation enough power to ultimately accomplish victory. Aang realizes that he must master all four elements and end the War before this time. For most of their journey to the North Pole, the group is pursued by <b><a href=#>Zuko</a></b>, a banished Fire Nation prince and son of Fire Lord Ozai who is obsessed with capturing Aang to restore his lost honor.
